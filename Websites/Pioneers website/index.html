            <p>Tim Berners-Lee is a computer scientist known for creating HTML, the first web browser and inventing the world wide web.</p>

            <p>While working at <a href="https://home.cern/">CERN</a>, Tim Berners-Lee proposed a project to facilitate the sharing and updating of data between researchers based on the concept of hypertext.  To do this he had to create the first  first browser program.  The first website was publish on the CERN network on 20 December 1990.  From 1991, Berners-Lee collaborated with other researcher on the WorldWideWeb project which lead to the creation of the World Wide Web and the internet services we now use.</p>

            <p>Tim Berners-Lee is now involved in advocacy and policy development. As director of the World Wide Web Foundation and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>, he is working to ensure that the web is freely available and assessible to everyone in the world.</p>
